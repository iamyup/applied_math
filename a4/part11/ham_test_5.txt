Subject: APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR BRAIN AND COGNITIVE ENGINEERING

Dear all,

in order to get the most out of tomorrow's lecture and the following ones, please bring to class:

- your laptop

- a working Python3 + Jupyter installation (See class notes. For Windows users, I recommend Anaconda - for Mac or Linux users, I think that the command line versions are good enough ^^)

- the downloaded github version of the lecture-notes containing all files (these were updated yesterday evening, so please re-download) https://github.com/cwallraven/Python-Lectures

See you tomorrow!

Best
