Subject: Join the ChattingCat Community - Meet Tutors, Students, and ChattingCat Members

Dear ChattingCat Students and Tutors,

We have received many encouraging and loving emails after we announced our service closure. We want to thank you for that. Knowing how much you loved ChattingCat means a lot to us. This is the biggest motivation that we can use to continue to fight for ChattingCat, and is the sole reason that we would like to revive ChattingCat or start something similar in the future.

Among the many emails, we received numerous requests from both Students and Tutors about whether or not they can exchange their personal contact information. As heavy ChattingCat users ourselves, we totally understand our customers will continue to require help from native English speakers after ChattingCat’s service shuts down.

Thus, we have come up with an idea, we will make a community group page (closed group) on Facebook and invite you. You can use the community to exchange your needs and seek help. We will also provide updates on how ChattingCat’s former members are doing, and detail our next journey. If we can revive ChattingCat or create something similar, we will let you know via the Facebook page. We hope to connect our valued customers who love to develop their English with the Tutors who love to help others grow.

If you are interested, please join the ChattingCat Community here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/chattingcatcommunity

Sincerely,

The ChattingCat Team
